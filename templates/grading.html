<h1>Suggested Climbing Progression for First-Timers</h1>
<p>For your first climbing experience, focus on grades between 4a and 5b. These routes offer a balance of challenge and accessibility, allowing you to build confidence and develop skills without being overly demanding.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Start with Grade 4a: Familiarize yourself with climbing movement and practice proper footwork.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Progress to Grade 4c: Challenge yourself with slightly more technical climbs.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Try a Grade 5a: Build stamina and experiment with new techniques like flagging or smearing.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Experiment with Grade 5b: Test your strength and problem-solving skills as you prepare for intermediate levels.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are able to do all of these as a first-timer then Well Done!! Anything over a 4c is a great grade for beginners.</p>

<h1>Climbing Grades (French System)</h1>
<p>Climbing grades are used to communicate the difficulty of climbing routes, helping climbers select challenges that suit their skill levels. The French grading system is one of the most widely used scales, particularly in Europe. Below, we explain the French grading system and provide examples of beginner-friendly climbs.</p>
<p>Below is a picture of all climbing grades in comparison to the different grading systems.</p>

<h1>Understanding the French Grading System</h1>
<p>The French system uses numbers followed by letters (e.g., 5a, 5b, 5c) to indicate difficulty:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Grades 1-3: Very easy climbs, often suitable for children and complete beginners. These routes involve basic scrambling and minimal verticality.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Grades 4a-4c: Easy climbs, requiring basic footwork and hand placement. Ideal for those new to climbing.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Grades 5a-5c: Moderate climbs that introduce more technical moves and require improved balance and strength.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Grades 6a-6c: Challenging climbs for intermediate climbers, with more complex sequences and stronger grip requirements.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Grades 7a and Above: Advanced climbs with difficult moves, overhangs, and high physical demands. Reserved for experienced climbers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each grade can include a “+,” indicating a slightly harder variation within the same level (e.g., 5a+).</p>
<p>For your first climbing experience, focus on grades between 4a and 5b. These routes offer a balance of challenge and accessibility, allowing you to build confidence and develop skills without being overly demanding.</p>
